                    <li>Made his acting debut in 1982 in TVB after passing the training courses of the television channel, having played extras and supporting roles including the kind-hearted rich student Ying Ji-him in <i>Soldier of Fortune</i> (1982), which starred Felix Wong and Patricia Chong.</li>

He then starred in few more TV roles like <i>The Grand Canal</i> (1987), <i>Two Most Honorable Knights</i> (1988), and <i>Ode to Gallantry</i> (1989), which was his last before leaving TVB.</li>
                    <li>By the time he left TVB to fully concentrate on his film career, he has already become one of Hong Kong TV's household names and an acting veteran.</li>
                    <li>His role in John Woo's 1992 action film <i>Hard Boiled</i>, in which he co-starred with Chow Yun-fat, was a breakthrough for his career as a movie actor.
